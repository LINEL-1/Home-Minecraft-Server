# Home Minecraft Server
This is a step-by-step guide on setting up a home minecraft server.

## Prerequisites
*If you are planning to have under 5 players, you will need a system with at least:*
- 4 GB of DDR3 RAM
- 64 GB 5400RPM Hard drive (Prefferably 7200RPM)
- A 5th generation Intel CPU (Or AMD Ryzen series)
- Ethernet Capabilities

*Other things to consider for setting the server up are:*
- A USB flash drive
- A seperate laptop or computer
- A WIRED ETHERNET CONNECTION (IMPORTANT)
- Internet that doesn't use a mobile network
- A big dose of self control (This is because for the duration of this project, your computer must remain in one piece.)
